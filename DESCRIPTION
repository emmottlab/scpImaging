Description: This package includes functions for curating, manipulating, and visualising
    cellenONE-based imaging data for single-cell experiments. It is designed to
    work with microscopy images and associated metadata produced on the cellenONE platform, 
    which is a high-throughput imaging and handling system for single-cell analysis. It contains
    functions to process the initial images for downstream analysis in cellPose and cellProfiler, as well 
    as for importing and processing the data output from these pipelines. It also contains a 
    module for interactive visualisation of cellenONE-based images using the iSEE package for 
    interactive single-cell experiment exploration.
